# This script runs 'makepkg -g' on a copy of PKGBUILD where all if/elif/else/fi
# statements have been removed, and then uses sed to replace the old checksums
# in PKGBUILD with the new ones. The original PKGBUILD is backed up to
# PKGBUILD.bak.
#
# The script assumes that all checksums in the original PKGBUILD are strings of
# 32 or more hexadecimal characters ([0-9a-f], greedy), and that all such
# strings are checksums. 'SKIP' checksums are not updated.
#
# Note that since this script works by replacing checksum strings with new
# values, it only updates existing checksums. If a source file has no checksum
# specified, it will not be given one by this script.
