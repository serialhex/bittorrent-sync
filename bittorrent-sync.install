  User-specific BTSync configuration

  Helps to set ownership to someone other than root for files that are copied
  with btsync. A default configuration file is automatically created at
  ~/.config/btsync/btsync.conf if this file does not exist. You may want to
  change the device_name, webui.login and webui.password settings. You can
  either edit the config file directly or use the
  /usr/share/bittorrent-sync/btsync-makeconfig.sh script, pass it the --help
  flag to learn more about it.

  To start btsync, execute:

  $ systemctl start btsync@user

  where 'user' is your username.

  ================

  Note that you may need to run
  # systemctl --system daemon-reload
  before systemd recognizes the new service definitions.
