  User-specific BTSync configuration

  Helps to set ownership to someone other than root for files that are copied
  with btsync. Copy /etc/btsync.conf to ~/.config/btsync/btsync.conf for
  the user you wish to configure btsync as:

  mkdir -p ~/.config/btsync
  cp /etc/btsync.conf ~/.config/btsync/btsync.conf

  Replace user-specific references with the appropriate information,
  particularly the following settings:

  - webui.listen
  - webui.login
  - webui.password

  The systemd script (/usr/lib/systemd/system/btsync@.service) assumes the
  following two settings:
  - storage_path: $HOME/.config/btsync
  - pid_file: $HOME/.config/btsync/sync.pid (default, leave this commented out)

  To start btsync, execute:

  systemctl start btsync@user

  where 'user' is your username.
