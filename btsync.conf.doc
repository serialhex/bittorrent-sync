/*
 * Configuration file for BitTorrent sync.
 *
 * The systemd daemon provided by the bittorrent-sync AUR package assumes that
 * the storage_path setting is set to "~/.config/btsync" and that the pid_file
 * setting is left at the default (commented out). If you change any of these
 * two settings, you will need to update the PIDFile setting in
 * /usr/lib/systemd/system/btsync@.service to point to the new pid file. By
 * default, it is located at storage_path/sync.pid.
